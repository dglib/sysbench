# SysBench for Docker Containers (17.06+)
My version of a MySQL driven Docker container benchmarking tool. I looked at a few repo's and started to build their versions for my own testing; however, I found that the build were too old or just simply no longer supported. Therefore, I'm pulling in data from a couple of the repos and trying to rebuild a better sysbench utility for my testing. I am sure there going to be issues, so this repo was created for testing 1 specific environment.
